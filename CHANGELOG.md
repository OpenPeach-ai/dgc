# DGC CLI changelog

Release notes for the `dgc` command-line tool and `dgc serve`. The VS Code extension has its own
[changelog](editors/vscode/CHANGELOG.md), and so does the SDK ([sdk/CHANGELOG.md](sdk/CHANGELOG.md)).
Earlier releases are listed at <https://vibedgc.com/changelog>.

## 0.41.6 — 2026-09-19

Editor protocol remains v14. Pair with extension 0.26.7 and dgc-sdk 0.5.3.

### For everyone

- **`repo_map` sees plain job folders.** A workspace that is not a git repository and holds only
  notes, CSV or other text files is no longer reported as 0 files. The map is rebuilt from disk on
  every call, so files added during a session show up the next time the agent maps the folder.
- **The sandbox also hides your real home directory.** With the OS sandbox on, shell commands
  could not read `$HOME`; they now also cannot read the account's home directory when `HOME`
  points somewhere else (as it does for SDK sessions), nor the SDK client's whole state directory
  (audit and usage logs, not just its isolated home).
- **The sandbox is checked, not assumed.** DGC now verifies that bubblewrap actually confines
  (unprivileged user namespaces can be disabled, or the binary can be too old) before reporting a
  sandbox available, so a "required" sandbox cannot pass on a host where every `bwrap` invocation
  fails.
- **Provider keys stay out of tool subprocesses.** DGC no longer hands `DGC_API_KEY` (or the
  other `DGC_*_API_KEY` values it consumes) to the environment of a `bash`, `python`, `monitor`
  or hook subprocess, in any mode, so `printf %s "$DGC_API_KEY" | rev` in an unsandboxed shell no
  longer recovers the key. The model client still uses it.
- **Release builds are green again.** The v0.41.4 and v0.41.5 tag builds failed (an SDK socket
  path too long on macOS, and the extension's tests), so those versions have no GitHub Release.
  Both causes are fixed for 0.41.6. Every GitHub Action in the release, CI and CodeQL workflows
  is pinned to a commit.

### For applications that embed DGC (dgc-sdk 0.5.3 needs these)

- **Session policy.** `dgc serve` accepts a per-process policy from the program that starts it,
  in the `DGC_SESSION_POLICY` environment variable: deny and ask rules, auto-mode-only denies, and
  sandbox settings. The rules hold in every permission mode, `auto` included, cannot be removed by
  a command or a mode switch, and are never written to any config file. A policy that does not
  parse denies every tool. The `ready` handshake reports the policy it read
  (`capabilities.session_policy`), so the launcher can confirm it took effect.
- **Unattended shell only in the sandbox.** A session policy can require that, in `auto` mode,
  `bash` and `monitor` run only inside the OS sandbox and that the `python` tool (which is never
  sandboxed) is refused. In the other modes each shell command stays a permission request.
- **Workspace rules cannot pre-approve commands for an SDK policy.** When the launcher's policy
  says so (`project_allow: false`), the workspace's own `.dgc/permissions.json` may add ask and
  deny rules but its allow rules are not loaded — and neither are the user's own stored allow
  rules — so a cloned repository, or an inherited `~/.dgc`, cannot approve its own shell commands.
- **Workspace agent definitions are gated too.** A new `project_agents: false` in the session
  policy stops `dgc serve` from loading a workspace's `.dgc/agents/*.md`, which can choose a model
  endpoint and a credential env var. When the launcher does allow them, a project definition
  contributes only its persona: its `base_url`, `api_key_env`, `api_mode` and `model` are dropped,
  and no agent definition (project or personal) may read a `DGC_*_API_KEY`.
- **Searches respect denied paths.** A session policy's ask on search tools reaches the launcher
  in `plan` mode too, so a search over a tree that contains a denied path can be refused; the
  refusal is attributed to the application's policy, not to the user.
- **A launcher can hand a key through a file.** `dgc serve` reads a provider key from
  `DGC_<NAME>_API_KEY_FILE` (a 0600 file) and deletes the file before any tool runs, so the key
  never sits in the child's environment block.
